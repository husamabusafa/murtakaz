Below is a **clean, executive-grade dashboard framework** mapped **directly to your BRD + addendum**, not a generic BI list.

Think of this as a **dashboard catalog** you can put straight into the BRD, PRD, or RFP.

## What Makes These Dashboards Different (Important)

✔ System-calculated health
✔ Strategy-bound (not user-defined)
✔ Drill-down traceability
✔ Governance-aware
✔ Executive-trustworthy

This is **not BI for reporting** — it is **BI for decision-making**.

---

## How This Fits Cleanly Into the BRD

You can add a short section:

> **“Dashboards shall be role-based, system-calculated, and aligned to the strategic object model. Dashboards must support drill-down from Pillar to Contribution level and reflect governance rules defined in this BRD.”**

---

If you want next, I can:

* Turn this into a **dashboard requirements table**
* Map dashboards to **PowerPoint slides**
* Define **acceptance criteria per dashboard**
* Prioritize **Phase 1 vs Phase 2 dashboards**

Just tell me where you want to go next.
