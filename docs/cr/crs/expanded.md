### Scorecards & KPIs in Spider Impact: In-Depth Explanation

**Scorecards** are the core of Spider Impact — the central hub where organizations build, manage, and monitor their entire performance strategy. They are hierarchical trees that organize strategic elements from high-level goals down to granular metrics.

At the bottom are **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators), also called measures or metrics. These feed upward through automatic roll-ups to provide scores for objectives, perspectives (e.g., in Balanced Scorecard), and the overall organization. This creates a clear, visual "big picture" of how day-to-day performance drives strategic success.

#### 1. Scorecard Structure & Hierarchy (The Scorecard Tree)
- Scorecards are organized in a **tree view** (left sidebar in the Scorecards section).
- Top levels: High-level items like **Perspectives** (e.g., Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, Learning & Growth in Balanced Scorecard) or custom categories.
- Mid levels: **Strategic Objectives** (e.g., "Increase Revenue" or "Improve Customer Satisfaction").
- Bottom levels: **KPIs/Measures** (the actual tracked data points).
- Scores roll up automatically: KPI performance → objective scores → perspective scores → overall scorecard score.
- Supports **cascading**: Build separate scorecards for departments, teams, geographies, or individuals, all linked to the main organizational strategy for alignment.

#### 2. Creating & Managing Scorecards
- **Start Simple**: Use guided setup or import from templates/spreadsheets.
- **Build from Scratch**:
  - Navigate to **Scorecards** section.
  - Create new items via **+ New** (objective, KPI, or perspective).
  - Drag-and-drop to reorganize the tree.
- **Advanced Tools**:
  - **Copy, Templates & Rollups**: Duplicate entire scorecards or use pre-built templates for similar structures (e.g., copy a departmental scorecard and roll up values to corporate).
  - **Linked Scorecards**: Track a KPI once but display it in multiple scorecards (e.g., a shared revenue metric in sales and finance views).
  - **Themed Scorecards**: Create specialized views (e.g., by project, risk, or compliance).
- **Balanced Scorecard Support**: Native automation for the classic 4-perspective model, including auto-generated **Strategy Maps** (visual diagrams showing cause-and-effect links between objectives).

#### 3. KPIs/Measures: The Foundation
- **Types of KPIs**:
  - Numeric (most common): e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction score.
  - Text-based (scored): e.g., "High/Medium/Low" with color thresholds.
  - Yes/No: Binary tracking with success defined.
  - Unscored: For tracking without scoring (e.g., raw counts).
- **Scoring System**:
  - **Normalized Scoring** (0–100 scale) with intuitive colors:
    - Green = On/above target.
    - Yellow = Caution.
    - Red = Below target.
    - Blue/Dark Green variants for advanced thresholds.
  - **Scoring Types**:
    - Goal/Red Flag: Set green/red thresholds; system auto-calculates intermediates.
    - Band: Custom color ranges.
    - Trend-based: Score based on improvement/decline.
  - **Calculated KPIs**: Auto-compute values from other KPIs (e.g., "Profit Margin" = Revenue ÷ Costs).
  - **Aggregation**: Sum, Average, Geometric Mean, Last Value, etc., for roll-ups.
- **Data Entry & Automation**:
  - Manual: Direct entry or forms.
  - Automated: Imports from Excel, databases, APIs, or datasets.
  - **Workflows**: Approval steps before values go live.
  - **Related Items**: Link initiatives, tasks, documents, or other KPIs to show impact.

#### 4. Visualization & Analysis
- **Tabs per Item**:
  - **Overview**: Current score, trend chart, targets.
  - **KPIs Tab**: List child KPIs with scores (red flag icon if issues).
  - **Charts/Graphs**: Line, bar, pie, bullseye, geographic maps.
  - **Strategy Maps**: Auto-generated, customizable visuals showing connections.
- **Drill-Down/Drill-Up**: Click any item to explore details or roll up to higher levels.
- **Dashboards**: Combine KPIs, charts, and scorecards into custom views.
- **Reports**: Advanced designer for lists of red KPIs, trending items, or aggregated data.

#### 5. Ownership, Alerts & Collaboration
- Assign **owners** (users/groups) to KPIs/objectives for accountability.
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for updates, missed targets, or deadlines.
- **Impact Assistant** (AI feature): Ask natural-language questions (e.g., "Show declining KPIs") for instant answers with visuals.

#### 6. Practical Examples
- **Balanced Scorecard**: Financial perspective → "Grow Revenue" objective → KPIs like "Training Revenue" and "New Client Acquisition."
- **Custom Use**: Non-profit tracking "Donor Retention" → KPIs for participation rates, automated from forms.
- **Business Intelligence Layer**: Use datasets to power advanced KPIs (e.g., slice sales data by region).

In essence, Spider Impact turns scorecards and KPIs into a living, real-time system: granular data entry at the bottom drives automated scoring and visualization at the top, ensuring everyone from executives to frontline staff sees their role in the organization's success. The platform is methodology-agnostic but excels at Balanced Scorecard implementations.
