### User Interaction with Spider Impact (from Bottom to Top)

Spider Impact is a **cloud-based strategic performance management platform**, so users interact with it entirely through a **web browser** (no installation needed). Access is role-based, with permissions controlling what each user sees and edits. The experience is intuitive, with guided setup, real-time updates, and features like dashboards, scorecards, and an AI assistant.

Here's the typical user journey, explained **from bottom to top** — starting with the most granular, day-to-day operational interactions and building up to high-level strategic oversight:

#### 1. Bottom Level: Data Entry & Collection (Operational Users / Data Contributors)
- **Login** — Users access the secure web platform using credentials (often with multi-factor authentication).
- **Data Input** — Frontline or departmental users enter or update raw data:
  - Manually update KPIs/metrics via forms or direct entry.
  - Use **no-code Forms** or the new **Apps platform** (introduced in version 5.8) to collect data like incident logs, participant details, donor interactions, or operational records.
  - Automate imports from external systems (e.g., databases, spreadsheets, APIs) for hands-off updates.
- **Task Management** — Users view assigned tasks (e.g., update a KPI by month-end) and receive email alerts/reminders.
- **Home Dashboard** — After login, users see a personalized Home page with alerts, pending updates, assigned tasks, and quick access to their KPIs ("My Measures/KPIs").

This level ensures accurate, timely data feeds the entire system.

#### 2. Mid Level: Building & Managing Performance Elements (Managers / Analysts)
- **Scorecards & KPIs** — Users create or edit scorecards (e.g., Balanced Scorecard), define objectives, measures/KPIs, and set targets/thresholds.
  - Link initiatives, tasks, and milestones to objectives.
  - Use workflows for approval (e.g., managers review/approve data before it's visible).
- **Initiatives & Projects** — Track strategic projects with timelines, budgets, and progress (including Earned Value Management features to predict on-time/on-budget completion).
- **Data Visualization & Analysis** — Build custom dashboards, charts, graphs, strategy maps (auto-generated or customized), geographic maps, and bullseye charts.
  - Drill down into details, apply filters, and explore trends.
- **Business Intelligence** — Use datasets for advanced analysis (import, link, slice/dice unstructured data).

#### 3. Top Level: Oversight & Decision-Making (Executives / Leadership)
- **Executive Dashboards & Briefings** — View high-level, real-time overviews of organizational performance.
  - See color-coded scores (normalized system: green = on target, red = issues) and drill down to root causes.
  - Run **Briefings** (like live presentations) with slides pulling real-time data — no manual prep needed.
- **Strategy Maps** — Visualize the entire strategy on one page, showing how objectives cascade and connect.
- **AI Assistance** — Use **Impact Assistant** (conversational AI in version 5.8) to ask natural-language questions like "What's our customer satisfaction trend?" and get instant answers with visuals.
- **Reporting & Collaboration** — Generate customizable reports, share dashboards externally (if permitted), set bookmarks/alerts, and collaborate via comments/notes.
- **Strategic Decisions** — Use insights to align teams, spot risks, adjust plans, and ensure everyone contributes to organizational goals.

#### Key Supporting Features Across All Levels
- **Mobile-Friendly** — Web-based, so accessible on any device.
- **Role-Based Access** — Admins manage users, groups, and permissions.
- **Integrations & Automation** — Auto-update data, reducing manual work.
- **Learning Resources** — Guided setup, video tutorials, and downloadable user guides for quick onboarding.

In summary, interaction flows upward: operational users feed data → managers build and monitor structures → executives gain visibility and make informed decisions — all in one unified, real-time system. This creates a transparent "common operating picture" that drives alignment and performance.
